# Game Tracker

## Hey!

Recently, I finished up a course on React, and wanted to try out the knowledge and skills I picked up by creating a real, useful project. I decided to go with a game tracker, as it'll be useful to me. I've recently gotten into retro gaming, so I have a pretty large backlog that I'd like to be able to track. I think this accomplishes that pretty well.

This is the back-end, written with plain-old Node and Express. I chose Express for two reasons; it's super simple, and that's the framework I have the most experience with. As for using SQL instead of NoSQL, I've used MongoDB for most of my previous large projects, so I wanted to switch it up. As an added benefit, filtering is (in my opinion) less complicated in SQL than Mongo.

While most of the core functionality demanded by the front-end is fulfilled in this, there's definitely still some work that could be done. Like the front-end, I mostly need to refactor some stuff to make it prettier, but there's some functionality (specifically user accounts, so I can put it online) that I'd like to add. I'll be working on that over time.
